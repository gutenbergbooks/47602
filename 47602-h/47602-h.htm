</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE happiness that is
  added to human lives by love for the
lower creatures is beyond telling.
Ernest von Vogelweide,
the great German lyric poet of
the middle ages, so loved the birds
that he left a large bequest to the
monks of Wurtzburg on condition that
they should feed the birds every day
on the tomb-stone over his grave.</p>

<p>Of St. Francis of Assisi's love and
tenderness for birds and animals many
beautiful stories have been told. The
former he particularly loved, and 'tis
related they were wont to fly to him,
while he talked to, and blessed them.
From the hands of a cruel boy he
once rescued a pigeon, emblem of
innocence and purity, made a nest for
it, and watched over it and its young.</p>

<p>Of George Stephenson, the inventor,
a beautiful story is told. One day in
an upper room of his home he closed
the window. Two or three days afterwards,
however, he observed a bird
flying against, and violently beating
its wings as though trying to break
the window. His sympathy and curiosity
were aroused. What could the
little creature want? The window
was opened and the bird flew to one
particular spot. Alas! one look into
the little nest and the bird with the
worm still in its beak which he had
brought to the mother and his four
little ones, fluttered to the floor.
Stephenson lifted the exhausted bird,
and tried to revive it. But all his
efforts proved in vain. At that time
the force of George Stephenson's mind
was changing the face of the earth;
yet he wept at the sight of the dead
family and grieved because he had all
unconsciously been the cause of their
death.</p>

<h2><a name="BIRD_DAY" id="BIRD_DAY"></a>BIRD DAY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="100" height="93"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE United States Department of Agriculture issued in July,
1896, a circular suggesting
that a "Bird Day" be added
to the school calendar. In this circular
J. Sterling Morton, Secretary of
Agriculture, says:</p>

<p>"The cause of bird protection is one
that appeals to the best side of our
natures. Let us yield to the appeal.
Let us have a Bird Day&mdash;a day set
apart from all the other days of the
year to tell the children about the
birds. But we must not stop here.
We should strive continually to develop
and intensify the sentiment of bird
protection, not alone for the sake of
preserving the birds, but also for the
sake of replacing as far as possible the
barbaric impulses inherent in child
nature by the nobler impulses and
aspirations that should characterize advanced
civilization."</p>

<p>Prof. C. A. Babcock, superintendent
of schools, Oil City, Pa., who has acted
upon the suggestion in his schools,
says:</p>

<p>"The preservation of the birds is
not merely a matter of sentiment, or of
education in that high and fine feeling,
kindness to all living things. It has
an utilitarian side of vast extent, as
broad as our boundless fields and our
orchards' sweep. The birds are necessary
to us. Only by their means can
the insects which injure, and if not
checked, destroy vegetation, be kept
within bounds....</p>

<p>"What is most needed is the knowledge
of the birds themselves, their
modes of life, their curious ways, and
their relation to the scheme of things.
To know a bird is to love him. Birds
are beautiful and interesting objects of
study and make appeals to children
that are responded to with delight."</p>

<h2><a name="WHERE_MISSOURI_BIRDS_SPEND_CHRISTMAS"

  </a>WHERE MISSOURI BIRDS SPEND CHRISTMAS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_o.jpg" width="78" height="100"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">OF course we know where the
English Sparrow spends his
Christmas. And the Snowbird
came down in October
and is with us yet. Likewise
the Bluejay is here in many of our
yards, and is quite respectable&mdash;like
Eugene Field's boy, now that there
are no eggs to eat nor young birds to
destroy. The Redhead Woodpecker
is probably in the deeper woods,
though I have not yet seen him this
winter. Sometimes he goes south and
digs grubs off the tall, dead, southern
trees.</p>

<p>But we may be interested in where
some of our departed friends are
Christmasing.</p>

<p>All our other Woodpeckers stay
with us&mdash;except the Yellowhammer.
He has taken to feeding upon the
ground a good deal of late and does
not like it frozen.</p>

<p>The Redbreasted Woodpecker and
our two little Sapsuckers as we call
them, are always here in the winter&mdash;the
most optimistic birds we have.</p>

<p>I heard the Nuthatch only a few
days ago. I did not see him but I
knew by the way he talked through
his nose that he was hanging head
down on some nearby tree. The
only other little bird that climbs up
tree trunks&mdash;except the Woodpeckers&mdash;is
the Browncreeper, a rather rare
bird with us. Some years ago one of
the public school teachers sent me one
that a little boy had found so chilled
that it was helpless; so I suspect that
he ought to spend Christmas further
south&mdash;for his health.</p>

<p>In the woods, the Tree-Sparrow,
associating with the Snowbird, occasionally
sings us a Christmas Carol&mdash;the
only bird here now from which we
may expect a song, unless some vernal
day should loose the syrinx of the
Cardinal, or provoke the "<i>fee-bee</i>" of
the Crested Titmouse.</p>

<p>Christmas is on the vernal side of
the winter solstice and any sunny day
thereabout is more like spring than
autumn.</p>

<p>Sometimes in warm swampy places,
the Fox-Sparrow spends the winter
about us, but I have never seen any
here, though they are on the river
about Louisiana, Mo., now, I suspect,
along with the Winter-Wren. They
both sing occasionally in winter.</p>

<p>On our high backbone position here
at Mexico, between the rivers, we are
not favorably situated for bird study
because the little feathered folks prefer
the deep tangles of the river bottoms,
and they appreciate the fact that it is
naturally warmer there also. Even
Robins and Bluebirds sometimes stop
in these over winter here in Missouri.</p>

<p>The Doves and Blackbirds are mostly
in the southern states, but not far; for,
eating grain only now, they are after
climate rather than food. But such
birds as our swallows and the Fly-catchers&mdash;say
the Peewees, Bee-Martins,
and their kind&mdash;are much farther on
where the insects fly all the year round.
Some of them are in Florida and some
are in South America and a few perhaps
are banqueting in Old Mexico,
studying the silver question.&mdash;J. N.

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">DUSKY DUCK, Black Mallard,
Black English Duck,
(Florida), are some of the
names by which this well-known
member of the
family is recognized throughout eastern
North America, west to Utah, and
north to Labrador. It is much less
common in the interior than along
the Atlantic coast. It is called the
characteristic and one of the commonest
Ducks of New England, where
it breeds at large, and from thence
northeastward, but is most numerous
during the migrations.</p>

<p>The nest of the Black Duck is
placed on the ground, in grass or
rushes in the neighborhood of ponds,
pools, and streams, in meadows and
sometimes in swamps. It is a large
and neatly arranged structure of weeds
and grass, hollowed and lined with
down and feathers from the breast of
the bird. In rare instances it has
been known to build its nest in the
hollow of a tree, or a "stub" projecting
from the water of a swamp. Mr.
Frazer found the nest of this Duck in
Labrador usually placed upon the out-reaching
branches of stunted spruces,
which are seldom higher than four
feet.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are from
six to twelve in number, usually seven
or eight, and vary in color from pale
buff to pale greenish buff. The nesting
period is from the last of April to
the early part of June.</p>

<p>The Black Duck is a very wary
creature, exceedingly difficult of approach.
They are found in great numbers,
except when congregated on salt
water, five to ten being an average
flock started from pond and feeding
ground.</p>

<p>During very severe winters, says
Hallock, when every sheet of water is
bound in with a thick covering of ice,
the Black Ducks are driven to warm
spring holes where the water never
freezes. The approach of evening
drives the Ducks from the bay or
sound, where they have been sitting
during the day, and they seek these
open inland spots for food and shelter.
Brush-houses are constructed of sedge,
cedar boughs, etc., at the mouths of
fresh water rivers and creeks, in places
where the marsh land is low and intersected
by branches of the main stream.
Here the Ducks come to feed at night
and are taken by hunters who are concealed
in the bushes. These houses
are left standing, however, and the
wary Ducks soon avoid entirely this
locality, and feed elsewhere. The
brush-house building on feeding
grounds cannot be too severely condemned.</p>

<p>Hallock observes that of all the
birds which during spring and fall
traverse our country probably none
equal these Ducks in point of size, numbers
and economic value. The group
is confined neither to the sea coast,
nor to the interior, but is spread out
over the whole breadth of the continent,
in summer extending its migrations
to the furthest north, and in
winter proceeding only so far south as
it is forced to by the freezing of the
waters of its northern home.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STORMY_PETREL" id="THE_STORMY_PETREL"></a>THE STORMY PETREL.</h2>


<p>"The Stormy Petrel, mamma,
is a very interesting bird. I
should like very much to be in
a ship and see him walking on
the water, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Mamma, who thought of the
apostle St. Peter, shook her
head.</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken, Bobbie,"
said she. "I never heard
of a bird that could walk on the
water."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what my magazine
says," replied Bobbie, "and
I am sure <span class="sc">Birds</span> ought to know.
Listen!" and Bobbie, stopping
to spell a word now and then,
and to ask the meaning of many,
managed to inform his mother
what the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> had to say
about himself.</p>

<p>"Though I am the smallest of
the web-footed birds I am a
great traveler," read Bobbie.
"Everywhere over the entire
surface of the watery globe you
will find members of my order;
far north in the Arctic seas and
away down in the Southern
oceans. We love the sea, and
the food which is thrown up by
the waves. Anything oily or
greasy we particularly like. No
matter how stormy the weather,
nor how high the billows roll,
you will see us little fellows,
with outstretched wings,
sweeping along in the hollow
trough of the sea. From one side
of a ship to the other, now far
ahead, then a great way behind,
catching up easily with the
ship though making ten knots
an hour."</p>

<p>"What is a knot, mamma?"
querried Bobbie.</p>

<p>"A knot means a sailors' mile.
An engineer says his locomotive
runs at the rate of so many miles
an hour; a seaman says so many
'knots.' A knot is something
more than our English mile."</p>

<p>"The sailors call us 'Mother
Carey's Chickens.' Because we
walk and run on the surface of
the water they think us uncanny,
foretelling bad weather, or something
else bad for the crew,
when&mdash;let me whisper it into
your ear&mdash;it is our outstretched
wings which uphold us, our
wings as well as our broad,
flat feet.</p>

<p>There is something else I
want to tell you though before I
close. Think of making a lamp
out of a bird's body! That is
what they do with a <i>Stormy Petrel's</i>
body on a certain island in the
Atlantic ocean. They find our
carcass so oily from the food we
eat, that all they have to do is to
draw a wick through our body,
light it, and lo they have a lamp."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">PETRELS are dispersed
throughout all the seas
and oceans of the world.
Wilson's Stormy Petrel is
one of the best known
and commonest. It is to be met with
nearly everywhere over the entire
watery surface of the globe&mdash;far north
in the icy regions of the Arctic seas
and south to the sunny isles of southern
oceans. It breeds in the months
of March, April, May, June, July and
August, according to the locality, in
the northern latitudes of Europe, eastern
and western North America. Dr.
J. H. Kidder found it on Kerguelen
Island, southeast of Africa. He had
previously seen the birds at the sea
coast off the Cape of Good Hope, and,
on December 14, saw them out by day
feeding on the oily matter floating away
from the carcass of a sea-elephant. The
birds, he says, frequent the rocky parts
of hillsides, and flitting about like
swallows, catch very minute insects.
"Mother Carey's Chicken," as it is
called by sailors, is widely believed to
be the harbinger of bad weather, and
many superstitions have grown out of
the habit which they possess of apparently
walking on the surface of the
water as the Apostle St. Peter is
recorded to have done. It is the
smallest of the web-footed birds, yet
few storms are violent enough to keep
it from wandering over the waves in
search of the food that the disturbed
water casts to the surface.</p>

<p>The Stormy Petrel is so exceedingly
oily in texture, that the inhabitants of
the Ferol islands draw a wick through
its body and use it as a lamp.</p>

<p>Wilson gives the following account
of its habits while following a ship
under sail:</p>

<p>"It is indeed an interesting sight to
observe these little birds in a gale,
coursing over the waves, down the
declivities, up the ascents of the foaming
surf that threatens to bend over
their head; sweeping along through
the hollow troughs of the sea, as in a
sheltered valley, and again mounting
with the rising billow, and just above
its surface, occasionally dropping their
feet, which, striking the water, throws
the birds up again with additional
force; sometimes leaping, with both
legs parallel, on the surface of the
roughest wave for several yards at a
time. Meanwhile they continue coursing
from side to side of the ship's
wake, making excursions far and
wide, to the right and to the left,
now a great way ahead, and now
shooting astern for several hundred
yards, returning again to the ship, as
if she were all the time stationary,
though perhaps running at the rate
of ten knots an hour! But the most
singular peculiarity of this bird is its
faculty of standing and even running
on the surface of the water, which
it performs with apparent facility.
When any greasy matter is thrown
overboard these birds instantly collect
around it, and face to windward, with
their long wings expanded and their
webbed feet patting the water, which
the lightness of their bodies and the
action of the wind on their wings
enable them to do with ease. In calm
weather they perform the same maneuver
by keeping their wings just
so much in action as to prevent their
feet from sinking below the surface."</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Eaton says that this species
nests under large rocks not far from
the beach. Egg, one, white.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ALMOST everywhere in the
United States this active
little bird may be found,
inhabiting chiefly open,
high woods. Often he
may be seen along streams, skipping
and darting about among the topmost
branches of the trees, his long tail
elevated and jerking in wren-like
fashion, always moving about and
ever uttering his wheezy, squeaky
notes. Ridgway says that during the
breeding season the male has a varied
song of considerable power, but lacking
in sweetness, and uttered in an
erratic manner, portions of it suggesting
a weak imitation of the Catbird's
medley.</p>

<p>It is as a nest builder that the
Gnatcatcher is best known. Davie,
whose life study has been nests and
eggs, says that as a work of beauty
and ingenious architectural design the
nest of this bird has few equals in this
country. On the whole, it is a rather
frail structure, usually built in the
small upright twigs or saddled on the
horizontal limbs of trees at heights
ranging from ten to fifty feet, but
generally at an elevation of about
fifteen or twenty feet. The typical
nest has high, compact walls, contracted
at the brim, and gracefully
turned; the interior is deeply cupped,
and the exterior is beautifully ornamented
with lichens. The opening
is always at the top. Often the nest
is attached to a limb of the same
diameter as itself, thus appearing as a
knot or other excrescence. If, as
Baskett says, "there can be no doubt
that a bird may take delight in the
skill of its work and the beauty of its
home, as well as in its plumage," the
dainty residence of the Blue-gray
Gnatcatcher would indicate that the
pretty little bird experiences a great
amount of pleasure indeed. She lines
her nest with soft, downy materials&mdash;cotton-like
substances of withered
blossoms and the silky down of the
milkweed&mdash;fine, wiry grasses, horsehair,
and an occasional feather from
her own breast. In this she lays four
or five eggs of greenish or bluish
white, speckled with chestnut.</p>

<p>Col. Goss describes this bird as as
much at home in the shrubby bushes
on the hillsides or mesquite growths
on the plains, as within the tree-tops
of the heavily timbered bottom lands;
a nervous, restless species that, in their
quest of insect life, nimbly skip from
branch to branch, with partially
spread wings and flirting tails, held
more or less erect, now and then
darting like a flash into the air to
catch the passing flies; a tireless
picture of bustling energy, that only
ceases with the day. The soft,
warbling love song is varied, tender,
and full of melody, but so low, the
hearer must stop to listen in order to
fully catch its silvery tones.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_AMERICAN_COOT" id="THE_AMERICAN_COOT"></a>THE AMERICAN COOT.</h2>


<p>I have a number of names:
Mud Hen, Crow Duck, and Blue
Peter. It's all the same to me.
What's in a name anyway?
Wouldn't a rose smell just as
sweet if it were named Blue
Peter, too?</p>

<p>Well I am an aquatic bird,
and can quack with the best of
them and swim with them, too.
I go along beautifully on the
water. My feet are very remarkable,
the toes being fringed by
a membrane which assists me
greatly in swimming as well as
walking over the ooze. I call
them my mud-boards.</p>

<p>Such a lovely little thing as I
was when I came out of my
shell! that is what people, who
saw me at that time, say. My
down was jet-black and my
head a bright orange-scarlet
mixed with purple and blue.
I wish I looked half as handsome
now, but you can't paddle
around in the mud all day and
keep clean. That is I can't.
My coat is a sooty-black now
and I won't be able to change it
as long as I live.</p>

<p>Do you see that bare patch on
my forehead! Well, that accounts
for some people's calling
me a "Bald-headed Coot."
Maybe you will be called that
some day, too.</p>

<p>I don't often come to dry land,
but when I do I march along
very gracefully. I can fly, too,
though my wings do appear too
short for my size. I just stretch
my legs out behind my stumpy
tail, spread my wings, and away
I go.</p>

<p>I swim easily too, with a
peculiar bobbing motion of my
head and neck. You should
just see a lot of us patter over
the water, using our feet as
much as our wings, when
alarmed. And such a cackling
as we do keep up! Why, you
can hear us quite half a mile.</p>

<p>There is one thing about my
face I should like to have
changed and that is my nose&mdash;my
bill I mean. It is an ivory-white
and no matter how much
I stick it in the mud it will stay
white. It is a good mark, you
see, for a man with a gun, and I
am dreadfully afraid I shall
be shot some day. I have
seen a number of my mates
popped over just on account of
their white bills.</p>

<p>I visit you in April and leave
you in November when the
streams freeze over. I hope you
will have pleasant weather next
month, for I am making preparation
to visit you then.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">SCIENCE, in its classification
and naming of birds,
has rendered it quite easy
for any one to recognize
unmistakably anywhere
any specimen we have pictured in our
magazine. In some sections this interesting
Duck is known as the Mud-hen,
in others the Crow Duck, in still others
as the Ivory-billed Mud-hen, but with
the picture in hand or in mind, one need
never call the bird by any other than
its correct name, the American Coot.
The European Coot resembles it, but
its average size is slightly larger, its
habits, however, being in all respects
like those of its American relative.
Davie says that this is the water fowl
that the young sportsman persists in
shooting as a game bird, but at a riper
age he does not "hanker" after its
flesh.</p>

<p>The habitat of the Coot is very
extensive, covering the whole of North
America, middle America, and the West
Indies; north to Greenland and Alaska,
south to Veragua and Trinidad.</p>

<p>The Coot is a summer resident in
large marshes, and is not often rare in
any marshy situation. It arrives the
last of April and remains until the last
of November. It nests at the same
time as the Florida Gallinule (see
<span class="sc">Birds</span>, Vol. I, p. 121,) but shows a
greater preference for reed patches,
in which its nests are usually located,
often in from two to four feet of water.
The nests are generally larger than
those of Gallinules, and rarely composed
of other material than the dry
stalks of reeds and grasses. They are
placed on the ground, just out of the
water or on floating vegetation. Some
times immense numbers of Coots breed
together. The eggs are clay or creamy-white,
uniformly and finely dotted all
over with specks of dark brown and
black. From six to twelve eggs have
been found in a nest. As winter
approaches and the marshes and shallow
pools become covered with ice, these
birds congregate in immense flocks on
the rivers and small lakes, and
remain until cold weather closes the
streams.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson says the Coot has a
curious habit when approached by a
boat in a stream, rising often before
the boat is within gunshot, and flying
directly by the boatman, generally so
near that it may be easily brought
down. The abundance of Ducks and
other game birds has caused the members
of this family to be but little
molested, until within a few years,
when amateur sportsmen, finding
Ducks difficult to obtain, and
"Mud-hens," as Coots and Gallinules
are called, conveniently tame, have
turned their batteries upon them
and diminished their numbers about
many marshes. In the more retired
marshes, however, they still breed
abundantly. These birds differ from
the Gallinules in being social, going
in flocks, and in preferring the open
water. They sport and rest on musk-rat
houses and bare places of land and
dress their feathers there. During
the breeding season they keep near
their reedy cover, into which they
quickly swim and hide, in case of
danger. They swim and walk with
a nodding motion of the head.
They are not expert divers, but
go to the bottom when closely
pressed and unable to fly. The flesh
of the Coot is dark and not good eating,
and its feathers are not soft and downy;
it is, therefore, not sought after by the
pot hunter, nor considered a game bird
by the sportsman, for which reasons,
as well as the fact that the feathers
cannot be used by the ladies for personal
adornment, the birds are not shy
and are easily approached.</p>

  INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT BIRDS.</h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">SENSES of sight, smell, and
hearing are remarkably
acute in birds. This is
especially true of sight.
Some have three eye
lids, the upper and lower and a membrane
which can be drawn over the
entire eye-ball, called the nictitating
membrane, enabling them to look
directly at the sun. Eagles, Hawks,
and Owls are thus provided. The
eyes of the Eagles and Hawks are
provided also with a ring of bony
plates, by means of which the eye
adjusts itself like a telescope, taking
in both near and far objects.</p>

<p>Birds, except nocturnal species, have
no external ear, but hear well.</p>

<p>The young of nest building birds
when born are blind, naked, and unable
to walk. In the Hen, the Partridge, and
the Ducks, the young are able to walk,
swim, or pick up food, as soon as they
break the shell. When moulting, at
the close of the breeding season, Quails
usually shed in pairs. The male
generally assumes a duller hued coat
than the female.</p>

<p>With most birds of prey the female
is the larger.</p>

<p>Bird's songs are composed of love-notes
and pleasure-notes. We speak of
the scream of birds, their chirp, expressions
of joy or fear, as in the human voice.
Their songs can be set to music. See
S. P. Cheney's "Wood Notes Wild,"
in which the songs of many of our
common birds are thus reproduced.
The odd and peculiar actions of birds,
their dances, struts, and posturings
are all expressions of their emotions.</p>

<p>The nesting habits of birds are
varied. Gulls drop eggs on bare
ground or rocks; the Baltimore Oriole
and Tailor bird construct hanging
nests of elaborate workmanship; the
Woodpecker hews out a deep nest in
a rotten limb; the Kingfisher digs one
out of a sandy bank, while the Cuckoo
takes possession of the nest of some
other bird. Most birds select nesting
places away from other species, but
Swallows, English Sparrows, Grackles,
and Crows live in communities.</p>

<p>There are between seven and eight
thousand species of living birds.
A few species have become extinct,
specimens of which it is the
intention of <span class="sc">Birds</span> to present in future
numbers.</p>

<p>There are three centers of distribution
in the United States: (1) the Atlantic
states and Mississippi valley;
(2) the Rocky Mountain plateau; (3)
the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Most of the birds breeding in the
northern portions of the United States
migrate south during the winter
months. Those remaining are known
as residents.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_IVORY-BILLED_WOODPECKER" id="THE_IVORY-BILLED_WOODPECKER"></a>
  THE IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="59" height="125"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN size, though hardly in beauty,
this is indeed the prince of
Woodpeckers, the largest of
our North American species.
Its length ranges from nineteen
to twenty-one inches. There is one
other Woodpecker, called the Imperial,
which is larger, measuring twenty-three
or twenty-four inches in length.
This bird is found in Western Mexico,
north along the Sierra Madre, and
probably, according to Davie, has not
yet been observed within the limits of
the United States.</p>

<p>The Ivory-billed is now rare, and is
apparently restricted to the extreme
southern states, especially those bordering
the Gulf of Mexico. It is of
a wild and wary disposition, making
its home in the dark, swampy woodlands.
The dense cypress swamps
of Florida are one of its favorite
haunts.</p>

<p>The nest of the Ivory-bill is
excavated in a tree, about forty feet
from the ground, the cavity often
being nearly two feet in depth. Three
or more eggs are laid.</p>

<p>This bird does not remain long in
one place, and during the day ranges
over an extended territory. Its call is
a high, rather nasal, <i>yap-yap-yap</i>,
sounding in the distance like the note
of a penny trumpet.</p>

<p>To use the language of Chapman,
whose "Handbook" is a mine of
ornithological knowledge, Woodpeckers
are rather solitary birds, but
are sometimes found associated in
scattered companies during their
migrations. Above all other birds,
they are especially adapted to creep or
climb. The peculiar structure of the
foot, with its two toes directed forward
and two backward, except in one
genus, the Three-toed (which will
appear in the April number of <span class="sc">Birds</span>),
assists them in clinging to an upright
surface, while the pointed, stiffened
tail feathers serve as a prop when the
bird is resting. The stout, chisel-like
bill is used to cut away wood and
expose the hiding places of grubs, etc.,
when the long, distensible tongue,
with its horny, spear-like tip is thrust
in, the food impaled and drawn out.</p>

<p>All Woodpeckers are of value to the
farmer. It has been shown that two-thirds
to three-fourths of their food,
consists of insects, chiefly noxious.
Wood-boring beetles, both adults and
larvae, are conspicuous, and with them
are associated many caterpillers, mostly
species that burrow into trees. Next
in importance are the ants that live in
decaying wood, all of which are sought
by Woodpeckers and eaten in great
quantities. Many ants are particularly
harmful to timber, for if they
find a small spot of decay in the vacant
burrow of some wood-borers, they
enlarge the hole, and as their colony is
always on the increase, continue to eat
away the wood until the whole trunk
is honeycombed. Moreover, these
insects are not accessible to other
birds, and could pursue their career of
destruction unmolested were it not
that the Woodpeckers, with beaks and
tongues especially fitted for such work,
dig out and devour them. It is thus
evident that the Woodpeckers are
great conservators of forests. To
them, more than to any other agency,
we owe the preservation of timber
from hordes of destructive insects.</p>

<p>The Ivory-billed Woodpecker, living
his almost solitary life in the vast and
nearly impenetrable cypress swamps,
at a height of forty and fifty feet from
the ground, is rarely seen by man.
The specimens we present in <span class="sc">Birds</span>
are so nearly life-like that our readers
need only imagine themselves in the
dense forest of cypress to realize a very
natural scene.</p>

  THE IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER.</h2>


<p><i>Yap! Yap! Yap!</i></p>

<p>As I am called the prince of
Woodpeckers, I can, I suppose,
shout just as loud as I like. Of
course my cousin, the Red-bellied
Woodpecker, will turn up
his bill and say they only call
me the prince because I am the
largest of all the North American
Woodpeckers. Well, I
think that is reason enough,
don't you? Some creatures who
are not birds, have been called
princes and kings for less than
that&mdash;so I have heard.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Red-belly</i> had a great deal
to say about, and for himself, in
<span class="sc">Birds</span> last month; he sent his
picture, too. Pooh! he can't
compare with me. I am said to
be the most magnificent Woodpecker
of the whole lot. My
species is select, too, no matter
if he does say the whole family
of <i>Woodpeckers</i> are common. We
are considered rare birds. You
don't find us in all localities, no
indeed! You will have to travel
to the far, far south to catch a
glimpse of one of us magnificent
fellows. Should you ever go way
down on the Suwanee river, and
walk "real easy" through the
cypress forests you might get a
peep at one of us. But we are
wild and shy, and like to travel
long distances through the
day; no stay-at-home bodies
among us.</p>

<p>I'm not one of the three-toed
Woodpeckers, either, that Mr.
Red-belly was so anxious to tell
you about. It's very strange
how eager some people are to
talk about other people's imperfections.
I have four toes, two
in front and two behind, so it
isn't "sour grapes" that leads me
to speak as I do. I'll admit my
feet are peculiar, my toes assisting
me in clinging to an upright
surface, and my pointed stiff
tail-feathers serving to prop me
up when resting.</p>

<p>I think I am very fortunate,
too, in having such a stout,
chisel-like bill, and such a
horny, spear-like tongue. With
the first I cut away wood and
explore the hiding place of
grubs; with the latter I impale
them and draw the food out.
Dear, dear! How fearfully and
wonderfully we are made, to be
sure&mdash;birds as well as men.</p>

<p>Sing! No, wish I could. But
then I have a love-song which
my mate thinks is fine; 'tis a
long, rolling call, which I beat
with my bill.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SPARROW_HAWK" id="THE_SPARROW_HAWK"></a>THE SPARROW HAWK.</h2>


<p><i>Killy-killy-killy-killy!</i></p>

<p>That's my song and I don't
sing it very low either. It is
for that reason some people call
me the Killy Hawk.</p>

<p>The boys who spend much
time in the fields are very well
acquainted with me. Many a
time, I dare say, they have seen
me patiently sitting, for an hour
or more, on a lofty branch waiting
for "something to turn up."</p>

<p>Something does generally turn
up, and that is a mouse. "Ah,"
says she, peeking out from her
nest, "there is nobody around,
so I will go out for a walk," and
out she comes, not noticing me
way up in the tree, of course.</p>

<p>Then I dive from my perch
and fly directly over her. A
mouse can't keep still, somehow,
and from point to point she runs,
zigzagging this way and that
way, giving me lots of trouble,
for I have to zigzag, too. After
awhile she stands still for a
minute, and so do I, up in the
air, my fan-like tail spread out
very wide, my head lowered and&mdash;well,
pretty soon it is all over
with Mrs. Mouse. But mice are
nuisances anyway, don't you
think? Just because people
have seen me do that little trick
they call me the Mouse Hawk.
I catch Sparrows, and other
small birds, so they call me the
Sparrow Hawk, too.</p>

<p>I don't care what they call me,
to tell you the truth, just so
they let me alone. It's not
pleasant to have a stone thrown
at you, or a gun pointed your
way&mdash;&mdash;if it is loaded, and they
generally are loaded, I notice,
with something that hurts.</p>

<p>My nest? Oh, I don't care for
that sort of work, so I never build
one. Any natural hole in a high
tree, the deserted hole of a Woodpecker,
or a Magpie's nest, is good
enough for me. Just a few
leaves in the bottom, and on
them my mate lays five eggs,
sometimes six, sometimes seven.</p>

  THE AMERICAN SPARROW HAWK.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_e.jpg" width="100" height="80"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">EVERY boy who has been in the
fields is familiar with this
beautiful little Hawk,
which is numerous everywhere
in North America. As Davie
felicitously says: "Here it may be
seen hovering almost motionless in
mid air, then suddenly swooping down
to the ground, arises again with perhaps
a field-mouse in its talons."
From this habit it receives the name
of Mouse Hawk, although it also preys
upon Sparrows and other small birds.
It is found almost everywhere, though
most abundant along streams where
grow the high sycamores, whose natural
cavities furnish suitable nesting places,
but meadows and fields are its retreats
when in search of food. It builds no
nest, but deposits its eggs in the
natural cavities of high trees, often in
the deserted holes of Woodpeckers,
or in crevices in rocks or nooks about
buildings. In the West it frequently
appropriates a deserted Magpie's nest.
Eggs of this Hawk were taken from
a crevice in a stone quarry in the
Scioto river, where the birds nested
for years. The Sparrow Hawk often
takes possession of boxes intended for
Pigeons, and it always proves to be a
peaceable neighbor. The nests generally
contain no lining, but in some
cases a slight bed of leaves or grasses
on a few chips are used. The eggs
are four to six, buffy white, speckled,
spotted, and blotched with light and
dark brown.</p>

<p>This Hawk is not as active or destructive
as others of the Falcon tribe.
Its flight is usually short and irregular,
darting here and there, often hovering
in a suspended manner for several
moments at a time. During the summer
months, it occasionally kills small
birds, but feeds chiefly upon mice,
lizards, grasshoppers, crickets, and the
like, as they are so much easier to
capture than full grown birds, and to
which they rarely turn their attention,
until the cold weather drives the other
forms of life, upon which they so
largely feed, into their winter beds.
The bird that suffers most outside of
the Horned Larks and Longspurs, is
the Tree Sparrow, as it prefers the
hedges and small thickets upon the
prairies, instead of the wooded lands,
for its sheltered home; its food in all
such cases being upon the open lands,
and whenever there is snow upon the
ground it drifts against the hedges and
forces the little birds to seek the bare
spots, quite a distance away, for the
seeds on or fallen from the weeds.
Here it is that the Hawk, says Goss,
successfully performs its work, by darting
from a perch and striking the
Sparrow, either upon the ground or
before it can reach its hiding place.</p>

  HINTS ON THE STUDY OF WINTER BIRDS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="59" height="125"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN attractiveness to children, says
James E. McDade, for the Committee
of Sixty of Chicago, no
department of natural history
surpasses Ornithology. Birds
are to be found everywhere. In the
city parks and suburban groves careful
observation will reveal objects of study,
even in the depths of winter. The
following suggestions are based on
practical work which has been done in
the G. W. Curtis school during the
past two years.</p>

<p>No satisfactory work can be done
until the children have been aroused
to sufficient interest to observe birds
for themselves. Pictures and descriptions,
however valuable as auxiliaries,
can never take the place of personal
observation. The best method of
arousing this interest is to go out with
the children and study the birds.
Opera glasses or field glasses will
greatly facilitate observation.</p>

<p>As a guide in description pupils may
have in mind the following points:
shape and size of bird; prevailing
color; marks on head, wings, throat,
or tail; shape of bill; length of tail;
where found (whether on the ground,
in trees, or climbing tree trunks).
These and other details should be
emphasized.</p>

<p>In all this work strict accuracy must
be insisted on. In the beginning,
pupils are apt to give inaccurate, and,
in some instances, highly imaginary
descriptions of birds. A good plan is
to encourage them to bring in written
descriptions of birds they have seen.</p>

<p>Such field work may well furnish
excellent subject matter for water color
work, as well as a basis for written
compositions. Good collections of our
native birds may be found in the Field
Columbian Museum and in the museum
of the Chicago Academy of
Sciences, and the curators of these institutions
will be found ready to give
teachers any aid in their power.</p>

<p>Mr. McDade mentions the following
as the most common winter birds of
this vicinity, not including swimmers
and waders: the English Sparrow, the
Snow Bird, the Bluejay, the Thistle-bird,
the Black-capped Chickadee, the
White-bellied Nuthatch, the Northern
Shrike or Butcherbird, the Horned
Lark, and the Crow.</p>

<p>In many parts of the country there
are good collections of birds which are
accessible, and which may, by a little
inquiry, be found by those interested.
We do not hesitate to say, however,
that the specimens of birds shown
monthly in this magazine have stimulated
the successful study of Ornithology
to a degree never imagined as
possible. The pictures are so true to
nature in color and attitude that they
are instantly fixed in the mind. We
know several instances where children
of eight and ten years have become by
its use so familiar with many birds
that they can draw and paint them
from memory with considerable fidelity.
<span class="sc">Birds</span> is indeed the best means of acquiring
speedy as well as accurate
knowledge of Ornithology desired by
those who do not expect to pursue the
study in all its scientific ramifications.
We refer with confidence to the recognized
authorities on the subject.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN beautiful contrast with the
Golden Pheasant (see <span class="sc">Birds</span>,
Vol. 1, p. 13) we present this
month the magnificent Silver or
Penciled Pheasant, also a native
of China, which has long been introduced
into Europe, but has been considered
to be fitted only for the aviary.
The Pheasant was long thought to
have been brought from the banks of
the river Phasis, now the Rioni, in
Colchis, and introduced into Europe
by the Argonauts. Newton says that,
as a matter of fact, nothing is
known on this point; and, judging
from the recognition of the remains of
several species referred to, both in
Greece and in France, it seems not
impossible that the ordinary Pheasant
may have been indigenous to England.</p>

<p>It was thought only a few years ago
that the successful propagation of
Pheasants was problematical, but now
the Mongolian, the English Ring-necked,
and the Chinese Golden Pheasant,
each has found a home in some
of the states, where it is increasing in
numbers. Why may not a similar
experiment be made with the Silver
Pheasant?</p>

<p>On Fox Island, in Puget Sound,
there is an oriental Pheasant preserve.
Mr. Frank Alling, the proprietor, is
securing the co-operation of other land
owners, and it promises to be a great
success. The varieties of Pheasants
which he is raising include all we have
mentioned in this article, as well as
the Copper, the Green, the Bronze, and
the Asiatic Ring-necks, with a curiosity
in the shape of a mule produced
by crossing and recrossing the Copper
and Asiatic Ring-necks. The mule
hens are very beautiful, but their eggs
will not hatch. Oriental Quails liberated
on the island have increased quite
rapidly. Among the many importations
are small Bantams from Woo
Sung, China, for hatching Pheasant
eggs and rearing the young birds;
Mandarin Ducks, from Japan, (see
<span class="sc">Birds</span>, Vol. I, p. 9); Wild Peacocks
and Bleeding Heart Pigeons, from
Calcutta, India, and Manila, respectively.</p>

<p>In England within recent years the
practice of bringing up Pheasants by
hand has been extensively followed,
and the numbers so reared, says Newton,
vastly exceed those that are bred
at large. The eggs are collected from
birds that are either running wild or
kept in a mew, and are placed under
domestic hens; but, though these
prove most attentive foster-mothers,
much additional care on the part of
the keepers is needed to insure the
arrival at maturity of the chicks; for,
being necessarily crowded in a comparatively
small space, they are subject
to several diseases which often
carry off a large proportion, to say
nothing of the risk they run of not
being provided with proper food or of
meeting an early death from some
predatory animal. As they advance
in age the young Pheasants readily
take to a wild life, and indeed can only
be kept from wandering in every direction
by being plentifully supplied with
food, which has to be scattered for
them in the places in which it is desired
that they should stay.</p>

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ALL ACCOUNTS I have read
about Eider Ducks say that
nests are robbed of their
down twice, the duck
supplying it each time
from her own body; the third time
the drake gives his white down, and
this is allowed to remain, declares a
writer in <i>Good Words</i>. But I was
told by farmers in Iceland that
now they never take the down until
the little ones are hatched. It has
been found that the birds thrive better
and increase faster when they are
allowed to live as nature meant them
to. So now the poor mothers are
no longer obliged to strip themselves
of all their down to refurnish their
despoiled nests. Sometimes, if the
quantity is very great, a little may be
taken, but enough must be left to
cover the eggs when the duck leaves
her nest for food.</p>

<p>A writer from Iceland, in speaking
of a visit to one of the Isafjord farms,
wrote: "On the coast was a wall
built of large stones, just above high
water level, about three feet high and
of considerable thickness at the
bottom. On both sides of it alternate
stones had been left out so as to form
a series of square compartments for
the ducks to make their nests in.
Almost every compartment was occupied,
and as we walked along the
shore a line of ducks flew out, one
after another. The house was a
marvel; the earthen walls that surround
it and the window embrasures
were occupied with ducks. On the
ground the house was fringed with
ducks. On the turf slopes of the roof
we could see ducks, and ducks sat on
the scraper."</p>

<p>About 10,000 pounds of eiderdown
are gathered annually in Iceland,
7,000 being exported to foreign
countries. Formerly the peasants
used to receive over 21 shillings a
pound, but the price has now fallen to
half that amount. The peasants seldom
receive money, and are obliged
to barter their down for merchandise
furnished by the Danish merchants at
the little settlements at the fjords. A
pound and a half of down is enough
to fill an ordinary bed-puff. These
very comfortable articles are found in
the guest room of every Iceland farm,
however poor and small it may be.
After a long, hard day in the saddle
the traveler longs for warmth and
shelter. These little guest rooms have
never had a fire in them, and built,
as they are, on the ground, there is a
dreadful chill on them. Once tucked
away in bed, and tired bones lose their
pains and stiffness, however, and well
covered with the down-puff, a delightful
sense of comfort follows.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THROUGHOUT Northwestern
Mexico and the border of the
United States, from Western
Texas to New Mexico and
Southern Arizona, this handsome
Partridge, called the Blue Quail, is
found in abundance, especially on the
dry mesas of the San Pedro slope of
the Santa Catalina Mountains, up to
an altitude of three thousand five hundred
feet. In Arizona they are found
in flocks of from six to ten, sometimes
more, in the most barren places, miles
away from water.</p>

<p>The Blue Quail, like all the other
western and southwestern species,
prefers to trust to safety to its powers
of running, rather than those of flight.
The great trouble is to start them from
the ground.</p>

<p>A slight depression under a bush
serves for the nest of this bird, which
is generally lined with a few coarse
grasses. Complete sets of eggs have
been found as early as April 25. The
eggs are extremely thick-shelled, of a
buffy-white or cream color. The
number laid ranges from eight to
sixteen.</p>

<p>The habits of this Quail do not
differ greatly from those of Bob White,
though they have not been fully
studied, and the species is of less extensive
distribution.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOUND_BIRD" id="THE_MOUND_BIRD"></a>THE MOUND BIRD.</h2>


<p>There are some peculiar birds in the
world, and one of the strangest is the
Australian Megapod, or Mound bird,
that allows nature to perform the labor
of hatching its eggs. In some parts
of the island continent are found many
mounds of considerable size and height,
which the first explorers took for burial
mounds. These were made by the
"Megapodius Tumulus," which uses
them for hatching its eggs. They have
sometimes considerable dimensions. A
nest that is 14 feet high and 55 feet in
circumference may be regarded as
large. Each Megapod builds its own
nest with materials which it gathers
from all sides, and these are exactly
what the gardener uses in the month
of March to make his forcing beds&mdash;namely,
leaves and decomposing vegetable
matter, which by their fermentation
give off an appreciable amount of
heat. In the forcing beds this heat
hastens the sprouting of the seeds; in
the nest it suffices for the development
and hatching of the young birds, and
the mother can go where she likes and
occupy herself as she wishes without
being troubled by the duties of sitting.
In the small islands of Ninafou, in the
Pacific, another bird has a somewhat
similar habit, in so far as it also
abandons its eggs, but in place of
obtaining the necessary heat from
fermentation it gets it from the warm
sand. The Leipoa or native Pheasant
of Australia acts like the Megapod and
watches the temperature of its mound
very closely, covering and uncovering
the eggs several times a day to cool
them or heat them, as becomes necessary.
After hatching, the young
bird remains in the mound several
hours; it leaves on the second day, but
returns for the night, and not until the
third day is it able to leave for good
the paternal abode.&mdash;<i>American Field.</i></p>

<h2><a name="THE_NEW_TENANTS" id="THE_NEW_TENANTS"></a>THE NEW TENANTS.</h2>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">By Elanora Kinsley Marble.</span></p>


<p>Mr. Wren had no need to inquire
the cause of his mate's distress, for at
this moment a loud and vehement <i>Jay-jay-jay</i>,
resounded from an adjacent
tree.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said he, "it is that villian
Mr. Blue Jay at last. I have been
expecting a call from him for some
time. I heard yesterday that he was
caught sucking the eggs of Mrs. Red-eyed
Vireo, and that Mrs. Dove was
mourning more than usual because
out of four beautiful eggs she had only
one left. But never you mind, my
dear, never you mind! He daren't
go near our nest you see, for Bridget
is out there with her broom, and if
he should dare attack us, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well!" chirped Mrs. Wren, who
at once saw the force of his reasoning,
"what would you do, Mr. Wren, should
he attack us? I'd like to know because?
I am quite sure what dear papa would
have done under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"So am I," responded Mr. Wren
with a chuckle, "so am I."</p>

<p>"So are you&mdash;what?" retorted Mrs.
Wren, angrily tapping the perch on
which she sat with her foot.</p>

<p>"Sure what your dear papa would
have done, my dear, under the circumstances.
Ha, ha, ha!" and Mr. Wren
flirted his tail over his head and
hopped about in anything but a dignified
or warrior-like manner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren surveyed him with contempt
and surprise.</p>

<p>"Of all the ex-as-per-at-ing
creatures," she said, "you are the
worst. First you whispered and bid
me be silent, and now just look at you
hopping about and jibbering like an
idiot! I wish Mr. Blue Jay <i>would</i>
come over here and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come over here?" Mr. Wren
almost turned a somersault in his
glee. "Come over here, my dear!
Not much! Don't you see that Kingbird
over there with his eye on Mr.
Jay! There's going to be a fight, a
real knock-down, feather-pulling fight,
and I&mdash;<i>I won't be in it!</i>" and Mr.
Wren whistled and chattered and
flirted his tail in a greatly relieved
and truly funny manner.</p>

<p>"If I wasn't so anxious about the
eggs," said Mrs. Wren, "I'd stay here
and see the fight, too. They are well
matched, both such fine, handsome
birds&mdash;especially Mr. Jay. Ah, how
it does all remind me of dear papa."</p>

<p>Mr. Wren could have laughed aloud
when he thought of her plain, crooked-legged
little father, but he only sniffed
and said something about Mr. Jay
being a saucy, impudent dude.</p>

<p>"But really, now, he is handsome,"
repeated Mrs. Wren, "only see how his
head feathers stand up! My, how
angry they both are. What can be
the matter, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"If you will stop talking for a
minute," returned Mr. Wren, "perhaps
we can hear. Mr. Blue Jay is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
great coward when it comes to fighting
one of his size. More than likely
he will sneak away, or fly off screaming
loudly at the first signs of attack."</p>

<p>"If you will stop your chatter,"
sharply retorted Mrs. Wren, "we
may hear what they are saying.
Listen, can't you?"</p>

<p>"You old thief and pickpocket,"
shrieked Mr. Kingbird, his head
feathers standing up like an Indian
chief's, "whose nest around here are
you lying in wait to rob?"</p>

<p>"What business is it of yours?"
retorted Mr. Jay with a sneer. "You
old tyrant! A nice fellow, indeed, to
be calling people names. The pot
calling the kettle black. Humph!"</p>

<p>Mr. Kingbird, aware of the many
young birds he had eaten in his time
concluded he had best confine himself
exclusively to the question of eggs.</p>

<p>"It's only a sneak," he replied,
"that will creep up when the mother
bird is off her nest and suck the eggs.
Nobody but a coward would do it.
The Mourning Dove's cries the other
day were truly heartrending. I made
up my mind then that the very first
time you crossed my path I would
thrash you."</p>

<p>"That's right, give it to him, give
it to him!" cried the birds in chorus,
a large number of which, attracted by
the quarrel, had formed themselves
into a ring about the tree tops. "He's
not only a thief but a bully,
always ready to whip a bird under
his size."</p>

<p>Mr. Blue Jay winced for a second,
for it is not pleasant to find one's self
hated, by all his fellow kind.</p>

<p>"I'll swear," said he, lifting up one
foot solemnly, "that I have not been
near the Mourning Dove's nest this
season."</p>

<p>"Nor the Red-eyed Vireo's?"</p>

<p>"Nor the Red-eyed Vireo's," affirmed
Mr. Blue Jay, slightly closing one eye,
and coughing behind his foot.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" chorused a dozen
voices, "we saw him around there this
very morning."</p>

<p>"And I," said a Bluebird, "saw him
destroy the eggs in Mrs. Mourning
Dove's nest, myself."</p>

<p>"So," sternly said Mr. Kingbird,
"the rascal adds perjury to his other
crimes. It is the duty of every honest
citizen of the woods and orchards to
rid the world of such a villain. Defend
yourself, Mr. Jay, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment a loud and vehement
"<i>Zeay, ze-a-y</i>," broke in upon Mr.
Kingbird's speech.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Catbird," said he, his
crest suddenly falling, "I think, I&mdash;will
attend to this case another time,"
and much to the disappointment of
the assembled crowd Mr. Kingbird
took wing and flew away.</p>

<p>No sooner was he gone than Mr.
Blue Jay nearly doubled himself up
with laughter.</p>

<p>"I thought that would make his
feathers fall," he said, resuming his
braggart manner. "I have noticed how
quickly he gets out of the way of Mr.
Catbird, though he will fight a Hawk,
or a Crow, or even an Eagle. He! he!
he! I imitated Mr. Catbird very well,
didn't I?" and the rogue, to show his
powers of mimicry, cried <i>Zeay, ze-a-y</i>,
again, then <i>Caw, caw</i>, like a Crow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
meowed like a cat, barked like a dog,
crowed like a Rooster, and finished
with a loud, harsh <i>Kee-oo, kee-oo</i>, which
put all the birds to flight.</p>

<p>"The Red-shouldered Hawk," they
one and all cried with frightened
glances into the air, and Mrs. Wren,
forgetting for the moment that it was
only Mr. Jay imitating Mr. Hawk, flew
over to her nest in the greatest consternation.</p>

<p>"Well, well," she said afterward
with a laugh, "it was 'much ado
about nothing' after all. But what a
clever fellow that Mr. Jay is to be
sure! Really I cannot help but admire
him, rogue though he is," and
with a pretty flutter of her wings Mrs.
Wren gathered the six speckled
treasures under her breast and sat
down to brood.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you could have
covered more than six eggs, my dear,"
said Mr. Wren tenderly. "You are
such a little body, you know. Mrs.
John last year, though, had ten in one
brood, did she not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sniffed Mrs. Wren, "and her
neighbors have never heard the last
of it. Such a gossip and braggart as
she is. Why, she tells every lady
bird that calls on her that her Mr.
Wren had three furnished houses when
he proposed to her; one in a knothole
of an apple tree, one on top of a
<i>very</i> high pole, and the other&mdash;well,
really I forget; under the roof of a
meeting house, I believe."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Mr. Wren, turning up
his bill, "that's the reason she accepted
him, I suppose. To my notion he is
a most unattractive fellow, ugly as he
is proud."</p>

<p>"Oh, handsome is as handsome
does," returned Mrs. Wren, "as our
landlady says. But you can't deny
that he makes my cousin a good
husband. It is very foolish for them
to boast so, for they can only occupy
one house at a time, and surely they
have to earn their food by searching
for insects and worms, precisely as we
do. Then, too, riches take wings
sometimes, and fly away, and as I told
one of my neighbors the other day, I
am just as happy in this old tin pot as
I would be on top of the highest pole."</p>

<p>"How glad I am to hear you say
that," returned Mr. Wren, tears
glistening in his little black eyes,
"for there can be no true happiness
without contentment&mdash;as our landlord
says. Dear little mate! Fourteen
days you must sit on the nest. How
tired you will be!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind that," replied
Mrs. Wren, "if only our birdlings
hatch out pretty and good. Once in a
while I will fly off for a little exercise,
you know, and, like Mr. John, you
will take my place on the nest and
keep the eggs warm."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mr. Wren, ruefully;
"I hadn't calculated on doing
that. But we will see. I'm off, now,
to get something to eat, and will fetch
you as delicious a spider or nice fat
canker worm as I can find. Ta, ta,
love!" and off Mr. Wren flew to the
orchard, singing as he went.</p>
